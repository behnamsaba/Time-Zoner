# Time Zoner ðŸ‘‹

This Expo project was developed using **create-expo-app** to build a **React Native** application with **TypeScript**. It leverages powerful date and time libraries such as **Luxon**, **jalaali-js**, and **jewish-date** to provide robust functionality.

Designed as a cross-platform solution, the application simplifies the conversion of time zones and supports various calendar systems, including **Chinese**, **Hebrew**, and **Gregorian**. With an intuitive interface, users can effortlessly manage events, calculate dates, and determine time and date differencesâ€”all with just a few taps.
